            <h3>ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.</h3>
            <p>
              Hi, I'm Maida Shafaq! I am a 21 year old final year student of
              Computer Science(BS), lived my life in Qatar and returned to my
              native country for higher education. I felt encouraged to choose
              this field by being impressed by technology advancement in Qatar.
              This state of mind makes me feel responsible to be a part of the
              development of Pakistan's technology. I passionately look forward
              to utilize my skills later in my career.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am eager to learn web development because I have a strong
              passion to become a full stack web developer. Irrespective of
              multiple efforts, I was not able to spend an extra amount of time
              to learn HTML, CSS, JS and many more during my 3 years of
              university till now myself, therefore I opt to choose this course
              to solely give my full time to learn it now. I've got an
              opportunity and I won't let it slip out of my hands this time. It
              is a great opportunity to develop my skills which will help me
              alot in my career.
            </p>
            <p>
              So far my specialty is front-end web design and development. I
              would love to explore more elements of HTML and CSS in this course
              which would enhance my knowledge. Moreover, I will experience a
              broad set of skills which will help me make my CV better and more
              importantly, improve my skills.
            </p>
